React Component Guidelines

Functional Only: Use functional components; class components are prohibited.

Hooks: Adhere strictly to the Rules of Hooks. Use useMemo and useCallback for expensive operations to optimize performance.

Error Handling: Implement error boundaries for component-level error management.
