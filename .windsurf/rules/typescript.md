TypeScript Standards

Strict Mode: No any types allowed without justification. Use type narrowing and guards instead of assertions.

Interfaces: Define explicit interfaces for all data structures. Do not rely on implicit types for public APIs.

Exports: Use named exports only; avoid default exports to ensure consistent naming.
