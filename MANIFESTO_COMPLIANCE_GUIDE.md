# Manifesto Compliance Guide for Business Users

The Integrity Agent enforces manifesto rules to keep value cases trustworthy. Follow this checklist before promoting artifacts.

## Core Rules and What You Must Provide
1. **Provenance First**: Link every KPI or assumption to a source (benchmark, customer data, or signed email). Add URLs or document IDs in the evidence field.
2. **Conservative Assumptions**: Flag optimistic estimates and provide rationale; prefer industry medians unless customer-owned data overrides.
3. **Persona Alignment**: Ensure recommendations map to the buyer persona and their KPIs. If unsure, tag the persona and request the agent to validate fit.
4. **Explainability**: Include plain-language reasoning in every deliverable. If the agent response feels opaque, re-run with the "explain like a CFO" prompt.
5. **Chain of Custody**: Avoid manual edits to generated formulas. If edits are required, document the change note so the Integrity Agent can hash and track versions.

## Pre-Promotion Checklist
- Evidence attached for each KPI target and ROI assumption.
- Benchmarks cited with percentile or sample size when available.
- Risks and dependencies captured in the canvas notes.
- Integrity Panel shows all rules as **pass** or includes remediation steps you accept.

## Handling Violations
- **Missing evidence**: Upload or link the source and rerun the Integrity Agent.
- **Over-optimistic targets**: Switch to conservative defaults and record justification.
- **Persona mismatch**: Update the buyer persona and refresh mappings.

## Communication Tips
- Share Integrity Panel excerpts in executive reviews to demonstrate governance.
- Use the compliance metadata in exported PDFs to accelerate security/legal approvals.
