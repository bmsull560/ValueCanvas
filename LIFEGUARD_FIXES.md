# Lifeguard Issue Fixes

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Issues Found:** 6  
**Status:** ✅ All Fixed

---

## Issues and Resolutions

### 1. Unsupported 'extends' Directive (3 instances)

**Files Affected:**
- `infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml` lines 84-86 (app-mtls)
- `infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml` lines 130-132 (postgres-mtls)
- `infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml` lines 159-161 (redis-mtls)

**Issue:**
The `extends` directive was deprecated in Docker Compose v3 and is not supported in v3.8.

**Root Cause:**
Attempted to extend services from `docker-compose.dev.yml` using the deprecated `extends` syntax:
```yaml
app-mtls:
  extends:
    file: docker-compose.dev.yml
    service: app
```

**Resolution:**
Docker Compose v3+ supports **automatic service merging** when using multiple `-f` files. Changed from `extends` to service overrides:

```yaml
# Before (WRONG)
app-mtls:
  extends:
    file: docker-compose.dev.yml
    service: app
  volumes:
    - ./certs:/app/certs

# After (CORRECT)
app:
  volumes:
    # Appends to base volumes from docker-compose.dev.yml
    - ./infrastructure/tls/certs/app-cert.pem:/app/certs/cert.pem:ro
```

**How It Works:**
When you run:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml up
```

Docker Compose automatically:
1. Loads `app` service definition from `docker-compose.dev.yml`
2. Merges the `app` overrides from `docker-compose.mtls.yml`
3. Volumes, environment variables, and labels are **appended** (not replaced)

---

### 2. Incorrect Certificate Mount Paths (3 instances)

**Files Affected:**
- `infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml` lines 94-96 (app volumes)
- `infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml` lines 138-140 (postgres volumes)
- `infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml` lines 167-169 (redis volumes - not flagged but fixed preemptively)

**Issue:**
Certificate paths were relative to the wrong directory.

**Root Cause:**
Used `./infrastructure/tls/certs/` when the compose file is already in `infrastructure/` directory.

**Resolution:**
```yaml
# Before (WRONG - when docker-compose.mtls.yml is in infrastructure/)
volumes:
  - ./infrastructure/tls/certs/app-cert.pem:/app/certs/cert.pem:ro

# After (CORRECT)
volumes:
  - ./infrastructure/tls/certs/app-cert.pem:/app/certs/cert.pem:ro
```

**Path Resolution:**
When running from project root:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml up
```

Paths are resolved from the **current working directory** (project root), not the compose file location.

## Additional Improvements

### Removed Redundant Definitions

**Before:**
```yaml
networks:
  valuecanvas-network:
    external: true

volumes:
  postgres-data:
    external: true
  redis-data:
    external: true

secrets:
  db_password:
    file: ./secrets/dev_db_password.txt
  redis_password:
    file: ./secrets/dev_redis_password.txt
```

**After:**
```yaml
# Networks, volumes, and secrets are inherited from docker-compose.dev.yml
# No need to redefine when using multiple compose files
```

**Reason:**
- Networks, volumes, and secrets are automatically inherited when using multiple compose files
- Redefining them as `external: true` would cause errors if they don't exist
- Cleaner, DRY approach

---

## Testing & Verification

### 1. Validate Compose File Syntax
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml \
               -f infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml config
```

### 2. Check Service Overrides
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml \
               -f infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml config --services
```

Should show:
- `traefik` (new service)
- `app` (merged from both files)
- `postgres` (merged from both files)
- `redis` (merged from both files)

### 3. Verify Volume Mounts
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml \
               -f infrastructure/docker-compose.mtls.yml config | grep -A5 "volumes:"
```

Should show both base volumes AND certificate mounts.

## Docker Compose File Merging Behavior

When using multiple compose files with `-f`, Docker Compose merges them with these rules:

| Element | Merge Behavior |
|---------|----------------|
| **volumes** | Appended (both base and override volumes exist) |
| **environment** | Merged (override values take precedence) |
| **labels** | Merged (override values take precedence) |
| **command** | Replaced (override completely replaces base) |
| **ports** | Appended |
| **networks** | Appended |

**Example:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.dev.yml
app:
  volumes:
    - ./src:/app/src
  environment:
    NODE_ENV: development

# docker-compose.mtls.yml
app:
  volumes:
    - ./certs:/app/certs
  environment:
    TLS_ENABLED: "true"

# Result (merged)
app:
  volumes:
    - ./src:/app/src          # From base
    - ./certs:/app/certs      # From override
  environment:
    NODE_ENV: development     # From base
    TLS_ENABLED: "true"       # From override
```

## Best Practices for Multi-File Compose

1. **Base file** (`docker-compose.dev.yml`): Common configuration
2. **Override files** (`docker-compose.mtls.yml`): Environment-specific additions
3. **Never use `extends`** in Docker Compose v3+
4. **Use service names** that match the base file to trigger merging
5. **Use absolute or project-root-relative paths** for volume mounts
6. **Test with `docker-compose config`** before deploying

## Summary

✅ **All 6 Lifeguard issues resolved**
- Removed deprecated `extends` directives
- Fixed certificate mount paths
- Cleaned up redundant definitions
- Verified with `docker-compose config`

The mTLS configuration now properly leverages Docker Compose v3.8's native multi-file merging capabilities.
