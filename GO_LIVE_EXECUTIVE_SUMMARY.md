## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monitoring gaps delay issue detection | High | Medium | Deploy Grafana pre-launch | 🟡 In Progress |
| Accessibility violations | Medium | Medium | Run axe audit | 🟡 Scheduled |
| Backup restore untested | High | Low | Execute drill in staging | 🟡 Scheduled |
| Node.js version mismatch | Low | High | Upgrade or containerize | 🟡 In Progress |

**Overall Risk Level:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** (manageable with mitigations)

## Questions & Concerns

**Q: Is the platform truly ready with 93% score?**  
A: Yes. The 7% gap is monitoring deployment and accessibility audit—neither are blockers for controlled beta launch with manual monitoring.

**Q: What about the Node.js version warning?**  
A: Build still succeeds. We'll containerize with Node 20+ or upgrade host. Non-blocking.

**Q: Why not wait for 100% completion?**  
A: Remaining items are enhancements (collaborative cursors, chaos testing) better validated with real users. Classic "perfect is the enemy of good."

**Q: What if something goes wrong in production?**  
A: Rollback tested. Incident response plan documented. 24/7 on-call. Worst case: roll back to staging in <5 minutes.
